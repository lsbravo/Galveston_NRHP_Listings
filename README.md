## Description

The National Register of Historic Places is a list of sites, buildings, and structures significant to the nation's history administered by the National Park Service. The National Park Service hosts spatial data for properties on the register at https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/data-downloads.htm. Their data includes external links for each property to the National Achives Catalog, which has PDFs of registration forms and metadata for architectural classifications. This map combines the two sources to show pins at each building with architectural classifications and listing dates in the popups.

The GeoJSON files were created with QGIS 3.28:
